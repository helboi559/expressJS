- Create a new GET route /datetime that will send the current date and time as a string to the browser. Hint: The method new Date() will create a new date object that has methods for retrieving the current date and time as strings.
- Create a new GET route /users/myname in the users.js routes file. The route should return your name to the browser.
- Create a new GET route /users/myfavoritemovies in the users.js routes file. The route should return your three favorite movies in an array to the browser. Hint: You may need to use res.json() instead of res.send().
- Stretch goal: Use res.render to render the above routes using the index.ejs template and modify the index.ejs template as needed. Or create your own users.ejs template.

* Create a new base route called /blogs. Copy the sampleBlogs.js file into your project and use require to import blogPosts into your file. Create a new GET route /blogs/all that returns an array of all the blog posts to the browser.
* Create and update GET routes nested under /blogs. /blogs/:blogId should return only a single blog post that matches the id field of the blog post to the blogId route param. Add query param handling to the /blogs/all route. The ?sort param should behave as follows: if ?sort=desc, the blog posts should be sorted by descending order based upon createdAt date; if ?sort=asc, the blog posts should be sorted by ascending order instead. Hint: use the .sort() method to sort the blogs.
